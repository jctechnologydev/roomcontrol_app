# SmartRooms App

**A project developed within the scope of the Applied Project discipline, designed to make classrooms more sustainable.**

## Project Overview

During the academic journey, newly arrived students often face challenges in finding information, such as:  
- **Where are classes of a specific curricular unit taking place?**  
- **How to locate a particular room?**  
- **What is happening in a room?** (e.g., teacher, discipline, room state: temperature, humidity, harmful gases)  
- **How to remotely control equipment?** (e.g., turning off air conditioning or lights often left on).  

### **SmartRooms Solution**  
The **SmartRooms** project combines the concept of Smart Cities with a bidirectional system to improve the academic experience.  
- **Control actuators** (e.g., air conditioning, lights).  
- **Receive room status updates** (e.g., temperature, humidity, harmful gases).  
- All interactions are available through an intuitive **mobile application**.
